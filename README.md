# YPU-diwali-kandilvikri.github.io

This is a website for the Diwali kandil vikri upakram of Yuvak Prabodhan Udyog.

I know I did use a way of using iframes stupidly but hey its mobile friendly so don't complain. Also has a toggle language button cuz why not.

Anyways back to thr project, let me explain the file structure. Oh, well its self explanatory if you understand a few errors in my translation. Also ignore the fact that I named a folder sidebar logos.

So yeah, there you go, this is my first ever complete website! (although it isn't interactive but you get it) Visit the website on [ypu-diwali-kandilvikri.github.io](ypu-diwali-kandilvikri.github.io).
